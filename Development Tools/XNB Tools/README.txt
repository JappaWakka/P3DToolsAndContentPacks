Usage:
* Open XNB Builder Download Link
* Download both XNBBuilder.zip & XnaForVS2022.zip on the linked page
* Read the instructions on what to install before you can use the software
* After installing everything, open xnbbuilder.exe
* Browse to the source files and select the ones you want to convert (you can select multiple files at the same time)
* Change the output directory if you want
* Press Convert and after a moment a pop-up will show up and you'll have your XNB files.
